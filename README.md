# A Hat in Time: Crowd Control

NOTE: This mod is still under development and is not officially supported by Crowd Control at this point. Please stay tuned for the initial release.

This mod adds Crowd Control support for the cute-as-heck indie platformer, A Hat in Time. Crowd Control is a Twitch extension that allows Twitch chat to convert bits, subs and channel points to coins, in exchange for effects. Check out https://crowdcontrol.live/ for more info.  

In addition to this mod, you will also need the CC Twitch extension and CC desktop app. Take a look at our Twitch extension setup here:
